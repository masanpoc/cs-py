# You're writing some code to determine how much it will cost
# to renew the tag on your license plate. Why? Because I just
# had to pay my tag renewal, and if I have to deal with this
# mess, so do you. 😛
#
# Georgia's tag renewal policies are unnecessarily
# complicated. I've simplified them to make this problem even
# doable. They are:
#
# - Everyone pays $20.
# - If you purchased your car before 2013 (in 2012 or earlier),
#   you also pay 1% of its current value in additional tax.
# - If the car is electric, you pay an additional $200 fee.
#   (This is real.)
# - To renew, you must have passed an annual emissions check,
#   unless your car is electric, or if you're 65 or over and
#   the car's age is 10 years or older.
#
# Your code should print one of two messages.
#
# If the person
# needs to pass an emissions test in order to renew their tag,
# it should print, "You must pass an emissions test first."
# This would be the message to print if emissions_passed is
# False and if they are not eligible for either exemption
# mentioned above.
#
# If the person is eligible to renew their tag, the code should
# print: "Your renewal fee is $__.",
# Round the renewal fee to the nearest integer. This will
# be $20, plus $200 if the car is electric, plus 1% of car_value
# if the purchase_year is less than or equal to 2012.


# Add your code here!
