# Write a function called st_dev. st_dev should have one
# parameter, a filename. The file will contain one integer on
# each line. The function should return the population standard
# deviation of those numbers.
#
# The formula for population standard deviation can be found here:
# edge.edx.org/asset-v1:GTx+gt-mooc-staging1+2018_T1+type@asset+block@stdev.PNG
#
# The formula is a bit complex, though, and since this is a
# CS class and not a math class, here are the steps you would
# take to calculate it manually:
#
# 1. Find the mean of the list.
# 2. For each data point, find the difference between that
#    point and the mean. Square that difference, and add it
#    to a running sum of differences.
# 4. Divide the sum of differences by the length of the
#    list.
# 5. Take the square root of the result.
#
# You may assume for this problem that the file will contain
# only integers -- you don't need to worry about invalid
# files or lines. The easiest way to take the square root is
# to raise it to the 0.5 power (e.g. 2 ** 0.5 will give the
# square root of 2).
#
# HINT: You might find this easier if you load all of the
# numbers into a list before trying to calculate the average.
# Either way, you're going to need to loop over the numbers
# at least twice: once to calculate the mean, once to
# calculate the sum of the differences.


# Add your function here!
def st_dev(filename):
    try:
        input_file = open(filename, "r")
        deviation = None
        count = 0
        total = 0
        num_list = list()
        for line in input_file:
            num_list.append(int(line))
            total += int(line)
            count += 1
        input_file.close()

        avg = total / count
        sum_diff = 0
        for num in num_list:
            sum_diff += (num - avg) ** 2
        deviation = (sum_diff / count) ** 0.5

        return deviation
    except Exception as error:
