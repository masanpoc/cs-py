# Write a function called most_active. most_active should take
# one parameter, a dictionary. The dictionary's keys will all
# be strings representing people's names. The dictionary's
# values will be integers representing days of activity on a
# course forum.
#
# most_active should return the name of the most active student
# in the class. That is, most_active should return the key
# whose value is the highest in the dictionary.
#
# For example:
#
# some_dictionary = {"Joyner, David": 14, "Chopra, Deepak": 22, "Winfrey, Oprah": 17}
# most_active(some_dictionary) -> "Chopra, Deepak"
#
# The key "Chopra, Deepak" has the highest value (22), so
# the function returns "Chopra, Deepak". You may assume
# there will not be a tie for most active.


# Add your code here!
def most_active(a_dict):
    max_days = 0
    max_name = None
    for student in a_dict:
        if a_dict[student] > max_days:
            max_days = a_dict[student]
            max_name = student
    return max_name


# Below are some lines of code that will test your function.
# You can change the value of the variable(s) to test your
# function with different inputs.
#
# If your function works correctly, this will originally
# print:
# Chopra, Deepak
some_dictionary = {"Joyner, David": 14, "Chopra, Deepak": 22, "Winfrey, Oprah": 17}
print(most_active(some_dictionary))
