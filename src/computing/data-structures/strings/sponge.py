# Write a function called mock. mock should take one
# parameter, a string. You may assume that the string will
# have only lowercase letters and spaces.
#
# Your function should return the same string, but any letter
# at an even index should be converted to uppercase.
#
# For example: mock("abcd efgh ijkl") would return
# "AbCd eFgH IjKl".
#
# Remember, you can use the ordinal function ord() to get the
# number associated with a single letter. For example,
# ord("a") returns 97. The number associated with lowercase
# letters is always 32 larger than the number associated with
# the equivalent uppercase letter. ord("a") is 97, and
# ord("A") is 65. ord("z") is 122, and ord("Z") is 90.
#
# Remember, you can use the character function chr() to
# convert a number back to a letter. For example, chr(65) will
# return "A".
#
# HINT: Treat all characters the same initially, then worry
# about taking care of spaces afterwards.


# Write your function here!
def mock(a_string):
    result = ""
    for idx in range(len(a_string)):
        if a_string[idx] == " " or idx % 2 == 1:
            result += a_string[idx]
        else:
            new_char = chr(ord(a_string[idx]) - 32)
            result += new_char
    return result


# Below are some lines of code that will test your function.
# You can change the value of the variable(s) to test your
# function with different inputs.
#
# If your function works correctly, this will originally
# print: "AbCd eFgH IjKl".

print(mock("abcd efgh ijkl"))
